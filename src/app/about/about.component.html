<h2>About this app</h2>

<p>
  Note: While the examples are hosted in an
  <a target="_blank" href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> app that uses
  <a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, that's just to make
  some things easier to build or demonstrate. None of the CSS Grid concepts are
  specific to Angular or Sass.
